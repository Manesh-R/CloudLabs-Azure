# Getting Started with Your Azure Virtual Machine and Compute Workshop
 
Welcome to your Azure Virtual Machine and Compute workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn about deploying an Azure-based windows virtual machine, install a basic webpage, and monitor VM performance. Let's begin by making the most of this experience:
 
## Accessing Your Lab Environment
 
Once you're ready to dive in, your virtual machine and lab guide will be right at your fingertips within your web browser.

### Virtual Machine & Lab Guide
 
Your virtual machine is your workhorse throughout the workshop. The lab guide is your roadmap to success.
 
## Exploring Your Lab Resources
 
To get a better understanding of your lab resources and credentials, navigate to the **Environment Details** tab.

2. You'll see the **Sign into Microsoft Azure** tab. Here, enter your credentials:
 
   - **Email/Username:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

3. Next, provide your password:
 
   - **Password:** <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

4. If prompted to stay signed in, you can click "No."
 
5. If a **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** pop-up window appears, simply click "Maybe Later" to skip the tour.
 
6. Now you can see Azure Portal Dashboard, click on **Resource groups** from the Navigate panel to see the resource groups.

**Note**: Ensure to perform all the lab steps in the RG named **azvmrg-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>**

## **Scenario 1 - Building a Virtual Network**
An **Azure virtual network** (VNet) is a representation of your own **network**  in the cloud. It is a logical isolation of the **Azure** cloud dedicated to your subscription. You can fully control the IP address blocks, DNS settings, security policies and route tables within this **network.** [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview).

### **Building a Virtual Network**

1. Click on **+ Create a resource**.

2. In the search box, type **Virtual Network** and select to open it.

     ![Create Resource](https://github.com/SpektraSystems/CloudLabs-Azure/blob/master/azure-virtual-machine-and-compute/instructions/images/vnet.png?raw=true)
     
3. Click on the **Create** button.

      ![create vnet](https://github.com/SpektraSystems/CloudLabs-Azure/blob/master/azure-virtual-machine-and-compute/instructions/images/vnet-create.png?raw=true)
      
4. On the **Create virtual network** blade, enter the following information:
    
    -  Subscription: **Select your subscription (1)**.
    
    -  Resource group: Select the exisiting resource group named **azvmrg-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)**
    
    -  Name: **DemoLabVnet1 (3)**
    
    > **Note:** If the portal advises the name is not unique, simply adjust the name. Once you create a unique name that is available, you will see a check mark at the end of the **Name** field.

    -  Region: Select the region you are using to perform the lab **(4)**.

    -  Click on **Next (5)**

7.  On **Add subnet** tab enter the following details and click **Add (3)**.
   
      - Name: **demolabsubnet (1)**
      
      - Subnet address range: **10.2.0.0 (2)**
      
      - Subnet size : Select **/26(64 addresses) (3)** from the drop down.
      
      - Click on **Add Subnet**.
