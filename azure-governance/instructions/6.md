## Scenario 7: Create a Blueprint

The first step in defining a standard pattern for compliance is to compose a **blueprint** from the available resources. In this scenario, create a new blueprint named **'MyBlueprint'** to configure role and policy assignments for the subscription, add a new resource group, and create a Resource Manager template and role assignment on the new resource group.

## Part A: Accessing Azure Portal

   > **Note:**  All actions that you perform in Azure require some level of permissions. These Azure Governance configurations that we are about to make require high levels of permissions, which for security reasons are not allowed for end users.
   To walk through the steps in the Lab we have created a simulation that you can click through. Follow the steps in the guide while navigating the interactive experience.

1. On the Windows desktop, click the **AzureBlueprints.exe** shortcut and maximize the window

## Part B: Create a new blueprint draft

1. In the left pane of the Azure portal, click **All services** then click **Management + governance**

1. Click **Blueprints**

1. On the **Getting started** blade, click **Create** under Create a blueprint

1. In the **Blueprint name** field copy and paste: **MyBlueprint** 

>   For the Blueprint name you can enter up to 48 letters and numbers, no spaces or special characters.

6. In the **Definition location** field click on the ellipsis ![Ellipsis](img/ellipses.png) to the right of the box, click on **Applications Team** management group, and then click on **Select**

1. Click **Next: Artifacts**

>   Review the list of artifacts that make up the blueprint sample. This sample defines two resource groups, with display names of **Production resource group** and **Pre-Production Resource Group**. The final name and location of each resource group are set during blueprint assignment. The **Production resource group** is assigned the Contributor role and the **Pre-Production Resource Group** is assigned the Owner and Readers roles. The roles assigned in the definition are static, but the user, app, or group that is assigned the role is set during blueprint assignment.

> Let's add more resources to the Blueprint definition.
